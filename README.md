## About the Plots

The plots show snapshots of the relative amplitudes of different spherical harmonic modes in binary black hole simulations from various numerical relativity catalogs (SXS, RIT, MAYA).  
They allow users to:
- Rotate, zoom, and inspect 3D fit surfaces obtained
- Identify data points with specific numerical relativity simulations
