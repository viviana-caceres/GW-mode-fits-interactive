    Snapshots of the \((\ell, m)\)-mode amplitudes, normalized to the \((2,2)\) mode, at selected times \(t\) relative to the peak of the \((2,2)\) mode, displayed on a grid of \(\chi_{1z}\) and \(\chi_{2z}\). Best-fit surfaces based on the leading-order fits defined in Eq. (1) of the paper are shown.
